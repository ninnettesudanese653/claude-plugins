# Socials Test Suite

Run comprehensive tests on all Socials tools to verify the extension and MCP server are working correctly.

## Mode Selection

**IMPORTANT: Before running any tests, ask the user which mode they want:**

```
Which test mode would you like to run?

1. **Dry Run** (safe) - Tests read-only tools only. Will NOT post, reply, or engage.
2. **Full Test** (destructive) - Tests ALL tools including posting and engagement.
   WARNING: This will create real posts, replies, likes, and connection requests!

Enter 1 or 2:
```

Wait for user response before proceeding. Default to Dry Run if unclear.

## Test Guidelines

1. **Always ask mode first**: Never run destructive tests without explicit confirmation

2. **Handle failures gracefully**: If a test fails, log it and continue with other tests

3. **Wait for page loads**: After navigation, wait 2-3 seconds before testing feed/content tools

4. **Clean up reminders**: In Full Mode, always remind user what to clean up at the end

5. **Report issues clearly**: If something fails, explain what the user might need to fix

6. **Timestamps**: Add timestamps to test posts/replies so they're identifiable

---

## Optional Parameters

The user may specify:
- `--dry-run` or `--safe` to skip mode selection and run non-destructive only
- `--full` to skip mode selection and run all tests (still confirms before destructive)
- `--platform x`, `--platform linkedin`, or `--platform reddit` to test only one platform
- `--skip-browser` to skip browser control tests (if tab is already set up)
